# Invoice

Produce a single-page printable invoice.

`example.html` is a finished example of this template — study its structure and quality bar, do not copy its copy.

## Workflow

1. Read the design system's `DESIGN.md` and `tokens.css` (see SKILL.md Step 0).
2. Layout:
   - Top band: studio brand on the left, "INVOICE" + number + date + due date on the right.
   - Two columns: From (sender) / Bill to (recipient) with addresses.
   - Project ref + payment-terms strip.
   - Line items table: description / qty / unit / amount.
   - Right-aligned totals block: subtotal, retainer, tax, total due.
   - Payment instructions (bank, wire, ACH).
   - Thank-you note + signature line.
3. Print stylesheet @media print to remove backgrounds.
4. Run `../../references/critique.md`.

## Output

Write the page to `design/<slug>/index.html` (assets next to it, relative paths), then follow SKILL.md: critique, publish.
